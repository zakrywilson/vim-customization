# vim-customization
My settings for VIM

### How to install
Just drop the `.vimrc` file into your home directory or copy/paste whatever lines you like into your existing one.

### My color scheme
If you want to use the same color scheme, install [molokai](https://github.com/tomasr/molokai) and place it in `~/.vim/colors/`.
